    <h1>Master of Puppets by Metallica</h1>
      <section class="about">
        <p>
          Master of Puppets was released by American metal band Metallica,
          released on July 2, 1986. The song was recorded between October-June,
          1985. The song's lyrical meaning, as lead singer James Hetfield
          explained, "deals pretty much with drugs. How things get switched
          around, instead of you controlling what you're taking and doing, it's
          drugs controlling you."
